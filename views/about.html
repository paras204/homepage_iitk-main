            <p class="section_description">Hey there folks!!<br> I am Sophomore Undergrad at IITK in Department of
                Electrical Enginnering. <br><br> You will find me quite shy, introvert and disciplined at the first
                meet, but once we start meeting more frequently, I might appear to be the most humorous person you would
                ever find!! (that's what she said :') )<br><br></p>

                                paint sometimes), and a voice good enough for singing (my sis and I had plans to start a
                                band if things wouldn't work out right XD).<br><br>I like cycling and playing badminton

                                which is getting deeper as I am advancing to my 4th sem in a year and a month.<br> Well
                                after receiving 3 different letter grades in my first three sem, I have managed a decent
                                CPI (as my friends say).<br><br> Talking of achievements, I am two times KVPY scholar,
                                have qualified NSEP 2019-20 and ofcourse have joined IITK (JEE-ADV man!!).</p>

                MCU, DC, football, GOT, Pirates of the Carribean and TBBT(my fav one;)) You can give me brownie points
                later if it helps:)</p>
